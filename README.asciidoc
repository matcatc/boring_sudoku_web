== Introduction

*Boring Sudoku Web*

So simple, it's almost boring.

For a long time I would solve a couple Sudoku puzzles during lunch on my wife's old iPad.
However, in late 2023 the app stopped working, likely due to an iOS update or app update.
Rather than trying to find another app or website, I decided to create one of my own.
This is that application.
It is designed for my personal use.


== Setup

=== Development

These steps assume some defaults.
Adjust them to suit your setup.

.Steps
* Lookup Debian package `python3-cherrypy3` version.
* Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
* Activate your virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
* Install version matching Debian: `pip install cherrypy==<version-from-previous-step>`
* Run the program: `python3 main.py`
* Open browser tab and go to `localhost:8080`

=== Deployment

These steps assume you are using Debian.

.Steps
* Install `python3-cherrpy3`.
* Clone the git repository into a installation directory.
* Update `server.conf` for which IP(s) and port to listen on.
* Update your firewall to allow access to the IP and port.
* Modify the included systemd `boring_sudoku_web.service` file to know the installation directory and full path to the executable `main.py`.
* Install the systemd `boring_sudoku_web.service` file and enable / start it.

=== Usage

==== Main page

* Pick how many blank spaces to have in your puzzle.
** More spaces is more difficult.
* Click generate.

==== Puzzle page

* Select a number at the bottom
* Click on a cell to put that number there. It will only be accepted if it is correct.
** This allows you to guess numbers to make the puzzle easier.
* Reload the page to get a new puzzle with the same number of blank spaces.
* To get a new puzzle with a different number of blank spaces, return to the home page.

== Requirements

.Key User Requirements
* Application shall work on all the computers I use at home, including: my wife's ancient iPad, my ancient toaster of a laptop, my gaming desktop.
* Application shall be simple to develop, maintain, and use.

| ID | Criticality | Requirement | Rationale

| {counter:reqID}
| Shall
| Application shall be a web app.
| I am unable and unwilling to develop and deploy to iOS.

| {counter:reqID}
| Shall
| Application shall have minimal client side behavior.
| It needs to run on an ancient iPad and should run on an ancient laptop.

| {counter:reqID}
| Shall
| Application shall support mouse and/or keyboard based input.
| It needs to run on desktop / laptop systems.

| {counter:reqID}
| Shall
| Application shall support touch based input.
| It needs to run on an iPad.

| {counter:reqID}
| Shall
| Application shall generate puzzles. Or take input from a separate puzzle generator.
| I don't want to deal with finding and downloading puzzles or any sort of manual entry.

| {counter:reqID}
| Shall
| Application shall have an easy sudoku puzzle mode.
| Other modes are nice, but easy mode is necessary for chill puzzle solving.

| {counter:reqID}
| Shall
| Application shall target Debian stable for deployment.
| I run Debian stable VMs in my homelab.

| {counter:reqID}
| Shall
| Application shall be self-contained and not require any internet connection.
| Simplicity, security, and allowing it to run offline locally.

| {counter:reqID}
| Should
| Application should not have any sort of scoring or points system.
| Previous iOS app had bugs where it'd incorrectly mark failures, which was upsetting.

| {counter:reqID}
| Nice
| Application may support multiple clients in parallel.
| I am the only intended user and only plan on playing on one device at a time.

| {counter:reqID}
| Nice
| Application may have per user history tracking of puzzle generation parameters.
| Be able to say something like "generate a new puzzle that is slightly easier/harder." Or be able to tune puzzle generation parameters for difficulty levels.
